# DNA-To-Protien-GUI

Working:

This is A C++ .net project.
Project Convert and inputted DNA String To RNA and then proteins contained in It.
Reaching to a Protien is done by using a 4 child tree.(Extension Of Binary Tree).


What You Have To Do:
Project was connected to mysql database. I lost the .db file. so you have to connect it with mysql or any database by changing connection string 
	String^ constring = L"datasource=localhost;port=3306;username=root;password=Noman123";
written on line 798 of form4.h and similiarly found any where. My Database Contained three feilds. Protien Symbols as Primary Key,Actual Name Of Protien,Description of Protien for Details Page.
Pictures of protiens for details page is available in GUIWORK folder.




Future Work:
1)
There is so much redundancy of code in form4.h
use one function and some efficient logic to reduce the no of lines in code.
2)
Pictures are stored in a folder. You can save it on database with BLOB datatype.

I'll update url of video of working project and will write a better readme whenever I'll get some time.
